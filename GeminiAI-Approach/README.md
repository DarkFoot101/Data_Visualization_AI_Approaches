**Approach: Using Gemini API for Data Visualization**

The Gemini API leverages highly advanced and superior models compared to other alternatives like Ollama. It provides a free API and facilitates seamless data visualization, making it an effective tool for analyzing data with ease.

**How to Run the Application**

1.	Set Up a Virtual Environment

o	Follow these steps to create a virtual environment: 

	Open your terminal or command prompt.

	Navigate to the project directory.

	Run the command: 

	python -m venv <your_environment_name>

	Activate the virtual environment: 

	Windows: 

	<your_environment_name>\Scripts\activate

	Mac/Linux: 

	source <your_environment_name>/bin/activate

2.	Install Dependencies
   
o	After activating the virtual environment, install the required libraries by running: 

o	pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run the Application

o	Start the application using the following command: 

o	python app.py

4.	Upload a File

o	In the Streamlit UI, upload a CSV file for analysis.

5.	Provide a Prompt
   
o	Enter a detailed and accurate prompt to generate visualizations or analysis results.

Drawbacks

1.	Specific Visualization Declaration Required:

o	Unlike PandasAI, the Gemini API cannot automatically infer the type of visualization needed unless explicitly defined in the code.

2.	Training Limitations:

o	While the Gemini API provides a robust foundation, its performance can be significantly enhanced with better training models to handle more complex and diverse visualization tasks.

By addressing these limitations, the integration of Gemini API can become a more versatile and powerful tool for data visualization.
