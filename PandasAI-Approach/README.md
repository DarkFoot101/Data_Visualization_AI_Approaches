First Approach: Using PandasAI for Data Visualization
PandasAI is a recently developed AI tool designed to integrate seamlessly with Pandas, enabling users to create data visualizations based on natural language prompts. This tool can be combined with either OpenAI or Ollama models to enhance its capabilities.
Why Ollama?
While using OpenAI requires an API key (which incurs costs), Ollama provides free access to its models, making it a cost-effective alternative. In this approach, we are leveraging Ollama for model integration.

How to Run the Application
1.	Set Up a Virtual Environment
Follow these steps to create a virtual environment:
o	Open your terminal or command prompt.
o	Navigate to the project directory.
o	Run the command: 
o	python -m venv <your_environment_name>
o	Activate the virtual environment: 
	Windows: 
	<your_environment_name>\Scripts\activate
	Mac/Linux: 
	source <your_environment_name>/bin/activate

2.	Install Dependencies
o	After activating the virtual environment, install the required libraries: 
o	pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run the Application
o	Start the Streamlit application by running the following command: 
o	python -m streamlit run qapp.py

4.	Upload a CSV File
o	Use the Streamlit interface to upload a CSV file for analysis.

5.	Provide a Prompt
o	Enter a well-structured and detailed prompt for the AI to generate accurate visualizations or analysis.

Challenges
1.	Model Limitations:
o	While OpenAI’s models offer advanced capabilities, they are paid services. Ollama, although free, still requires significant
 improvement and development to match the level of sophistication needed for seamless data visualization.

2.	Streamlit Integration Issues:
o	Streamlit may not work smoothly on certain machines due to configuration or compatibility problems.

3.	UI Enhancements:
o	The current interface can be improved using advanced front-end tools like React for a better user experience.

By addressing these challenges, this approach can become more robust and efficient in the future.
